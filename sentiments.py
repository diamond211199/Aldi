        You are an intelligent assistant. Analyze the following customer feedback and provide an analysis for **each feedback entry** in the given list.

        ### Task:
        For each feedback entry, analyze and classify it based on the following:
        1. Sentiment: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
        2. Category and Sub-category: Select a category and sub-category from the provided list below.
        3. Sentiment Score: A score between 0 and 1, where 1 is most positive and 0 is most negative.

        ### Rules:
        1. Provide exactly one output for each feedback entry. Do not skip any entry.
        2. Maintain the numbering from the input list. The output numbering must match the input numbering.
        3. If you cannot determine the sentiment, category, or sub-category for a feedback entry, return "Unknown" for that field.
        4. Always include a sentiment score, even if the sentiment is "Neutral."
        5. this is important note:-if Thanks, thx , thnkq tnk u , thank u ,Thank YOU!, all kind off thank you in feedback should be positive sentiment and category should be Quick Resolution and sub category as per feedback
        6. if the thank you, thx , thanq all thank you related feedback but if something is more with the thank you then it should go to positive but category and sun category will be by which feedback is with thank you 
        6. dont put ** before the sentiment,category, subcategory etc.
        7. some time rating is different and feedback is different so go with the feedback and put it into correct sentiment and categories and sub categories 
          example like :-
          INC3825539	3	No root cause shared	3	Neutral	General Process Feedback	Non-Specific Comments	0.5
          it shold be in negative but it has rating 3 but check feedback.
        8.dont change category and sub category it should go into corrrect sentiment and category
        9. very important rule:- dont put sub-category in different category
        10. and check rating also rating like 1 means bad and 5 means good it vary in between 1 to 5 so always check rating too.
        11.please make sure that every row must have correct sentement , category, sub category 
        12.dont give the errors
        13.and give exact accurate sentiments,category,sub-category,sentiment score 
        14.sentiment score is on feedback so check the score also whther sentiment will be negative positive or neutral
